        You should compile mkidp.cpp with any compiler and put
        the mkidp.exe file in bin directory.

        This utility will be used for create a processor modulle (.w32)
        from a simple dynamic library (.dll). This process consists of writing
        the processor declaration string into the file header (in fact into a gap
        between the MZ and PE headers).

        The same is with ld.cpp

	These utilities are not necessary for Linux/Mac.
