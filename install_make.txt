How to install SDK for Borland compilers
----------------------------------------

All source files are the same for all platforms and are compiled using the
same makefile. You need to specify target in the command line:

        make                                       -- for WIN32
        idamake.pl -D__LINUX__                     -- for Linux
        idamake.pl -D__MAC__                       -- for Mac OS X


WIN32 versions can be created only by Borland C++ CBuilder v4.0
Probably the old BCC v5.2 will work too, but we haven't checked it.

You can compile Windows modules under Windows.
You can compile Linux   modules under Linux.

To create idag64 modules, define the __EA64__ symbol. For example:

        make -D__EA64__

will compile a modlue for the 64-bit version of IDA.

Please note that idag64 itself is a 32-bit application, so the above line
compiles a 32-bit module that can handle 64-bit applications with idag64.

To create a true 64-bit debugger module, define the __X64__ symbol:

        make -D__X64__

This mode of compilation should be used only for debugger servers (all
other IDA modules are 32-bit).

Also, it is a good idea to create an optimized version of the module.
To enable optimizations, defined the NDEBUG symbol, for example:

        make -D__EA64__ -DNDEBUG

-----------------------------------------------

        Installation:

0. Unzip the archive with -d switch:

        unzip -d idasdk.zip

1. Edit file
        allmake.mak             modify pathes to your compilers and sdk

2. Add to your path:
        c:\idasdk\bin
        and you compiler directory

3. Compile and build utilities in ETC directory. See ETC\README file.

4. Run make in the SDK directory in order to create compiler
   configuration files (*.cfg)
